# This part deals with video as a background

    ##  Video has been added on top of hero section but with z-index -99 as last to fall behind the dark overlay
    ##  Multiple videos can be added such as webm and mp4, mp4 will be default if webm is not supported

    ## Why Videos
       - Videos are superheros of content delivery.
       - Videos can be super fast to attach with embed codes.
       - Custom video can be used using <video> tag with multiple <source>
            - controls such as autoplay, muted, loop go to <video autoplay loop muted>
            - src="../videoname" and type="video/webm" goes to <source>

       ## --> Best way to customized the video play is ###VideoJS
