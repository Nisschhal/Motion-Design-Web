# This part deals with video as a background

## Video has been added on top of hero section but with z-index -99 as last to fall behind the dark overlay

## Multiple videos can be added such as webm and mp4, mp4 will be default if webm is not supported

## Why Videos

- Videos are the superheroes of content delivery.
- Videos can be quickly embedded using shareable codes.
- Custom videos can be implemented using the `<video>` tag with multiple `<source>` elements.
  - Use `controls` for features such as autoplay, muted, and loop; for example, `<video autoplay loop muted>`.
  - Specify the video source with `src="../videoname"` and `type="video/webm"` for the `<source>` element.

## --> Best way to customized the video play is ###VideoJS
